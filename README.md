# heat-capacity-estimator
> A tool for estimating and predicting liquid and solid heat capacities based on 3D molecular structure.

Inspired by the work of Naef at predicting solid and liquid heat capacities based solely on a "true" molecular volume method.

## ToDo
- [] Get a table of all the VDW radii
- [] Build a method to read in 3d files
- [] Build the method to determine volume based on 3D structure and vdw radii
- [] Predict LCP/SCP based on volume
    - Have internal table of correlation parameters?
